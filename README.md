# Hi there, I'm Calvin, Its so nice to see you visit my Github page!

I graduated with a Masters in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Florida with a passion for propulsion systems, thermal-fluid dynamics, and advanced design optimization. I combine hands-on engineering experience with computational analysis to solve complex aerospace challenges.
